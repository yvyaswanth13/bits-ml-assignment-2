# M.Tech (AIML) Machine Learning - Assignment 2

## a. Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate an end-to-end predictive framework to classify financial credit risk profile ratings. Using data detailing demographic attributes, transactional relationships, and banking histories, the system implements 5 distinct classification models to accurately distinguish high-risk credit applicants from low-risk individuals.

## b. Dataset Description
* **Dataset Name:** UCI German Credit Dataset
* **Source Repository:** UCI Machine Learning Repository / OpenML (Data ID: 31)
* **Instance Count:** 1,000 instances
* **Feature Count:** 20 features (including numerical accounts status, credit durations, history paths, loan purpose, and employment length details)
* **Target Label:** Binary classification (`0` = Low Risk / Good Credit, `1` = High Risk / Bad Credit)

### Performance Comparison Table

| ML Model Name | Accuracy | AUC | Precision | Recall | F1 | MCC |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.7433 | 0.7787 | 0.6053 | 0.5111 | 0.5542 | 0.3698 |
| Decision Tree Classifier | 0.7133 | 0.7161 | 0.5366 | 0.4889 | 0.5116 | 0.3015 |
| K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier | 0.7067 | 0.6974 | 0.5195 | 0.4444 | 0.4790 | 0.2678 |
| Naive Bayes Classifier | 0.7200 | 0.7675 | 0.5385 | 0.6222 | 0.5773 | 0.3670 |
| Support Vector Machine | 0.7533 | 0.7818 | 0.6471 | 0.4889 | 0.5570 | 0.3888 |

### Model Performance Observations
* **Logistic Regression:** Demonstrates balanced optimization stability. Serves as a solid baseline because linear boundary formulations adapt effectively across normalized feature profiles without significant over-fitting.
* **Decision Tree Classifier:** Prone to regional variance partitioning. Showcases high interpretability splits but suffers slightly in generalization metrics due to deterministic partitioning thresholds.
* **K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier:** Exhibits lower structural consistency. Relies strictly on spatial distance proximity arrays, making it vulnerable to noise fields in dense 20-dimensional spaces.
* **Naive Bayes Classifier:** Exhibits strong conditional class probability mechanics, achieving the highest localized Recall score (0.6222), though at the cost of elevated False Positives.
* **Support Vector Machine:** Achieves superior hyper-plane separation stability across complex non-linear combinations, netting the highest overall Precision score (0.6471).

### Overall Winner for the Dataset
**Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is the clear performance winner. It registers the highest structural Accuracy (0.7533), the highest discrimination index capacity (AUC = 0.7818), and the top Matthews Correlation Coefficient score (MCC = 0.3888), making it the most robust option for minimizing financial lending defaults.
